  abstract = {The statistical tests used in the analysis of structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error are examined. A drawback of the commonly applied chi square test, in addition to the known problems related to sample size and power, is that it may indicate an increasing correspondence between the hypothesized model and the observed data as both the measurement properties and the relationship between constructs decline. Further, and contrary to common assertion, the risk of making a Type II error can be substantial even when the sample size is large. Moreover, the present testing methods are unable to assess a model's explanatory power. To overcome these problems, the authors develop and apply a testing system based on measures of shared variance within the structural model, measurement model, and overall model.},

  abstract = {The issue of common method variance (CMV) has become almost legendary among today's business researchers. In this manuscript, a literature review shows many business researchers take steps to assess potential problems with CMV, or common method bias (CMB), but almost no one reports problematic findings. One widely-criticized procedure assessing CMV levels involves a one-factor test that examines how much common variance might exist in a single dimension. This paper presents a data simulation demonstrating that a relatively high level of CMV must be present to bias true relationships among substantive variables at typically reported reliability levels. The simulation data overall suggests that at levels of CMV typical of multiple item measures with typical reliabilities reporting typical effect sizes, CMV does not represent a grave threat to the validity of research findings.},

  abstract = {Insufficient effort responding (IER) affects many forms of assessment in both educational and psychological contexts. Much research has examined different types of IER, IER?s impact on the psychometric properties of test scores, and preprocessing procedures used to detect IER. However, there is a gap in the literature in terms of practical advice for applied researchers and psychometricians when evaluating multiple sources of IER evidence, including the best strategy or combination of strategies when preprocessing data. In this study, we demonstrate how the use of different IER detection methods may affect psychometric properties such as predictive validity and reliability. Moreover, we evaluate how different data cleansing procedures can detect different types of IER. We provide evidence via simulation studies and applied analysis using the ACT?s Engage assessment as a motivating example. Based on the findings of the study, we provide recommendations and future research directions for those who suspect their data may contain responses reflecting careless, random, or biased responding.},

They also investigate how these extra-role behaviors affect customers' perceptions of justice, satisfaction, word of mouth, and purchase intent. The authors capture and match employee and customer perceptions regarding the relevant constructs following a complaint and recovery experience. The results indicate that employees' perceptions of shared values and organizational justice affect customer-directed extra-role behaviors. Furthermore, the authors find that extra-role behaviors have significant effects on customers' perceptions of justice and that these behaviors mediate the effects of shared values and organizational justice on customer justice perceptions. Their study reveals that customer ratings of justice affect the customer outcomes of satisfaction with recovery, overall firm satisfaction, purchase intent, and word of mouth. Finally, the authors show that customers' perceptions of justice mediate the effects that extra-role behaviors have on customer outcomes.},

This interest has generated a widespread belief that SATCOM is driven by the perception that the complaint handling process is just. To test how SATCOM is modulated by distributive, interactional, or procedural justice, we performed a meta-analysis of 60 independent studies of the antecedents and consequences of SATCOM. Results indicate that SATCOM is affected most by distributive justice, then by interactional justice, and only weakly by procedural justice. We also find that SATCOM mediates the effects of justice dimensions on word-of-mouth. However, contrary to common belief, SATCOM does not mediate the effects of justice dimensions on overall satisfaction and return intent. We draw on our results to suggest several avenues for further research.},

Although post hoc statistical detection and correction techniques for CMV have been proposed, there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding their efficacy. Because of disagreement among scholars regarding the likelihood and nature of CMV in self-report data, the current study evaluates three post hoc strategies and the strategy of doing nothing within three sets of assumptions about CMV: that CMV does not exist, that CMV exists and has equal effects across constructs, and that CMV exists and has unequal effects across constructs. The implications of using each strategy within each of the three assumptions are examined empirically using 691,200 simulated data sets varying factors such as the amount of true variance and the amount and nature of CMV modeled. Based on analyses of these data, potential benefits and likely risks of using the different techniques are detailed.},
